# Rami's Coding Bootcamp

For a colleague who has not had much (quality) training with programming.

This repository will be used to demonstrate Git and Github.
The Jupyter notebook files demonstrates and explain various aspects about the Python language and programming in general.
They also include tips for developing code solutions and for writing more self-documenting, organized, and easy-to-use scripts.
Each notebook covers a subset of all the intended topics to prevent any single one from getting too long.
