# Rami's Coding Bootcamp

For a colleague who has not had much (quality) training with programming.

This repository will be used to demonstrate Git and Github.
The Jupyter notebook file demonstrates and explains various aspects about the Python language.
It also includes examples and tips for developing code solutions as well as for writing more self-documenting, organized, and easy-to-use scripts.
